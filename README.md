- **Files**: Contains config files for both **Filebeat** and **Metricbeat**
- **Playbooks**: Contains all the playbooks for Ansible to deploy the **ELK** stack, **Filebeat**, **Metricbeat** and **DVWA**.
- **README**: Contains a thorough [README](Ansible/README/README.md) about the **ELK** stack and how to deploy it.


### Diagrams

This folder contains Network Diagrams I mapped out of the **ELK**/**DVWA** server network.


### Linux

This folder contains numerous *Linux* bash scripts I created during the program.
